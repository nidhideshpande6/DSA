# Bubble Sort Implementation in Java

```java
class Solution {
    // Function to sort the array using bubble sort algorithm.
    public static void bubbleSort(int arr[]) {
        int n = arr.length;
        // Outer loop for passes
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            boolean swapped = false;
            // Inner loop for comparison in each pass
            for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
                // Swap if elements are in the wrong order
                if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
                    int temp = arr[j];
                    arr[j] = arr[j + 1];
                    arr[j + 1] = temp;
                    swapped = true; // Mark swapped
                }
            }
            // If no swaps were made, the array is already sorted
            if (!swapped) break;
        }
    }
}
```
Explanation

#### Outer Loop:

The i loop ensures we make nâˆ’1 passes to sort the array.

With each pass, the largest unsorted element "bubbles up" to its correct position.

#### Inner Loop:

The j loop compares and swaps adjacent elements if they are out of order.

After every pass, the largest element in the unsorted section is moved to the correct position, so the range of j reduces with each iteration (n - i - 1).

#### Optimization:

The swapped flag ensures we stop early if the array becomes sorted before completing all passes.

#### Time Complexity
Best Case (Already Sorted Array): 

O(n) due to the swapped flag.

Worst Case (Reverse Sorted Array): 

O(n^2).
