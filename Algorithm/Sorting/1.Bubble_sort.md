# Bubble Sort Implementation in Java

```java
class Solution {
    // Function to sort the array using bubble sort algorithm.
    public static void bubbleSort(int arr[]) {
        int n = arr.length;
        // Outer loop for passes
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            boolean swapped = false;
            // Inner loop for comparison in each pass
            for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
                // Swap if elements are in the wrong order
                if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
                    int temp = arr[j];
                    arr[j] = arr[j + 1];
                    arr[j + 1] = temp;
                    swapped = true; // Mark swapped
                }
            }
            // If no swaps were made, the array is already sorted
            if (!swapped) break;
        }
    }
}
```
Explanation

#### Outer Loop:

The i loop ensures we make n−1 passes to sort the array.

With each pass, the largest unsorted element "bubbles up" to its correct position.

#### Inner Loop:

The j loop compares and swaps adjacent elements if they are out of order.

After every pass, the largest element in the unsorted section is moved to the correct position, so the range of j reduces with each iteration (n - i - 1).

#### Optimization:

The swapped flag ensures we stop early if the array becomes sorted before completing all passes.

# How Bubble Sort Works

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the list is sorted.

## Steps of Bubble Sort

1. Start from the first element and compare it with the next.
2. If the first element is greater than the second, swap them.
3. Move to the next pair of adjacent elements and repeat Step 2.
4. Continue until the end of the array (this completes one **pass**).
5. Repeat the process for the remaining unsorted part of the array, ignoring the last element after each pass because it is already in its correct position.
6. Stop when no swaps are made during a pass, meaning the array is sorted.

## Example

**Input Array:**  
`[5, 3, 8, 6, 2]`

### **Pass 1:**
- Compare `5` and `3` → Swap → `[3, 5, 8, 6, 2]`
- Compare `5` and `8` → No swap → `[3, 5, 8, 6, 2]`
- Compare `8` and `6` → Swap → `[3, 5, 6, 8, 2]`
- Compare `8` and `2` → Swap → `[3, 5, 6, 2, 8]`  
**Result after Pass 1:** Largest element `8` is in its correct position.

### **Pass 2:**
- Compare `3` and `5` → No swap → `[3, 5, 6, 2, 8]`
- Compare `5` and `6` → No swap → `[3, 5, 6, 2, 8]`
- Compare `6` and `2` → Swap → `[3, 5, 2, 6, 8]`  
**Result after Pass 2:** Second largest element `6` is in its correct position.

### **Pass 3:**
- Compare `3` and `5` → No swap → `[3, 5, 2, 6, 8]`
- Compare `5` and `2` → Swap → `[3, 2, 5, 6, 8]`  
**Result after Pass 3:** Third largest element `5` is in its correct position.

### **Pass 4:**
- Compare `3` and `2` → Swap → `[2, 3, 5, 6, 8]`  
**Result after Pass 4:** Fourth largest element `3` is in its correct position.

### **Final Result:**
`[2, 3, 5, 6, 8]`

## Key Observations

1. After each pass, the largest unsorted element is placed in its correct position.
2. The number of comparisons decreases with each pass.
3. If no swaps are made during a pass, the array is already sorted.

## Visualization

#### **Initial Array:** `[5, 3, 8, 6, 2]`

| Pass | Comparisons                          | Array State         |
|------|-------------------------------------|---------------------|
| 1    | `5 > 3 → Swap`, `8 > 6 → Swap`, `8 > 2 → Swap` | `[3, 5, 6, 2, 8]` |
| 2    | `6 > 2 → Swap`                      | `[3, 5, 2, 6, 8]`  |
| 3    | `5 > 2 → Swap`                      | `[3, 2, 5, 6, 8]`  |
| 4    | `3 > 2 → Swap`                      | `[2, 3, 5, 6, 8]`  |

## Time Complexity

- **Best Case (Already Sorted):** \(O(n)\) with optimization (no swaps).
- **Worst Case (Reverse Sorted):** \(O(n^2)\).
- **Average Case:** \(O(n^2)\).

Bubble Sort is simple and intuitive but inefficient for large datasets due to its quadratic time complexity. It is mainly used for educational purposes or when the dataset is small.
